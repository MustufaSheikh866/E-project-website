                <h2>Grace Bay Beach - Providenciales, Tunk and caicos</h2>
                <p>This beautiful and accessible beach is known for its powder-like shores, warm Caribbean waters, and
                    the off-coast barrier reef that protects the beach from wild Atlantic swells. You won't find much
                    seaweed, rocks, or pollution here—this untouched beach is part of the protected area of Princess
                    Alexandra National Park. Here, you can sunbathe on the soft white sand, walk along the seemingly
                    endless stretch of beach, and try water activities like diving, snorkeling, sailing, and fishing
                    excursions. Grace Bay Beach is the departure point for catamaran sails, snorkeling tours, day and
                    sunset cruises, and more. – Tripadvisor</p>

                <h2>Four Mile Beach (Port Douglas, Queensland)</h2>
                <p>Four Mile Beach is a stunning, expansive stretch of coastline located in Port Douglas, Queensland,
                    Australia. It is named for its length, extending approximately four miles (about 6.4 kilometers)
                    along the Coral Sea. Known for its natural beauty, the beach features soft golden sands,
                    crystal-clear waters, and a backdrop of lush rainforests and the mountains of the Daintree National
                    Park.

                    The beach is ideal for swimming, relaxing, and strolling, offering scenic views of nearby Low Isles
                    and the Great Barrier Reef. However, the waters can sometimes be subject to strong currents, so
                    caution is advised for swimmers. The northern end of Four Mile Beach is quieter and more serene,
                    while the southern section, closer to Port Douglas, has more facilities, including cafes, resorts,
                    and shops.
