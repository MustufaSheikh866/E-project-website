                                                <p>The Bay of Islands is an area on the east coast of the Far North District of the North Island of New Zealand. It is one of the most popular fishing, sailing and tourist destinations in the country, and has been renowned internationally for its big-game fishing since American author Zane Grey publicised it in the 1930s. It is 60 km 37 mi north-west of the city of Whangārei. Cape Reinga, at the northern tip of the country, is about 210 km 130 mi by road further to the north-west.

                                                    The bay is an irregularly-shaped 16 km 10 mi-wide, 260 km2 100 sq mi drowned valley system and a natural harbour. It contains 144 islands, of which the largest is Urupukapuka, and numerous peninsulas and inlets. The three largest inlets are Waikare Inlet in the south, and Kerikeri and Te Puna Mangonui inlets in the north-west.</p>

                            <p>Known for its geothermal activity, Hot Water Beach allows visitors to dig their own hot
                                pool in the sand at low tide. The striking contrast of the hot, mineral-rich water and
                                the cool ocean makes for a unique beach experience.
                                Highlights: Digging your own hot pool, surfing, and exploring the nearby Cathedral Cove.

                                                <p>Hot Water Beach is a beach on the east coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand, just south of Mercury Bay.[1] It is approximately 12 kilometres south east of Whitianga, and approximately 175 kilometres from Auckland by car. Its name comes from underground hot springs that filter up through the sand between the high and low water tidal reaches. The beach is a popular destination both for locals and tourists visiting New Zealand. Annual visitor numbers have been estimated at 700,000, making it one of the most popular geothermal attractions in the Waikato region.

                                                    Care needs to be exercised as the location of the hot springs are not far from the sea even at low tide, and visitors may be caught unaware by the large breaking waves. Hot Water Beach is known for its dangerous rip currents, holes and large waves. Signs at the beach advise swimmers not to swim within 50 m either side of the off-shore rocks (opposite the springs), and to only swim between the flags of the Hot Water Beach Lifeguard Service.</p>

                                                <p>A government subsidy was given in 1878, to promote the start of regular steamer services from Manukau Harbour, which took about 8 hours. Until the main road was metalled in 1921, most goods travelled by sea. The wharf remained important until the 1950s, peaking in 1954, with 15,462 tons, handled by 38 ships. One of the problems was the shallow bar at the entrance to the harbour. For example, the Holmburn was stuck there for 26 hours in 1962. However, like other small ports, the main problem was the introduction of the inter-island roll-on roll-off ferries in 1962, with 40 Watersiders Union members made redundant in 1972, though cement volumes increased to a peak of 41,351 tons in 1974. Again the bar was a problem for the larger cement ships and, since John Wilson 1961-85 246 ft 75 m long, 42 ft 13 m wide, 18.5 ft 5.6 m deep, 1679 Grt made the last call on 7 July 1982, the only goods landed at the harbour have been fish from the fishing boats.

                                                    Until 1874 goods were transferred off the beach below Cliff Street and small boats moored in a boat harbour, cut off from the harbour by construction of a sluice-gate under Wallis Street causeway in about 1918.
                                                    The new road gave access to a new dairy factory and the wharf opened in 1921. A small wooden jetty and storage shed beside Cliff Street was built in 1874</p>

                                                <p>Abel Tasman National Park is a national park at the north end of New Zealand's South Island. It covers 237.1 km2 (91.5 sq mi) of land between Golden Bay / Mohua and Tasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere, making it the smallest of New Zealand's national parks. Despite this, the park is one of the most visited, partially due to the popularity of the Abel Tasman Coast Track which spans 60 km (37 mi) along the eastern and northern coastal areas of the park.

                                                    The area of the park has seen human interaction for approximately 700 years, with evidence of habitation dating back to early Māori iwi such as Waitaha and Rapuwai during the early periods of Māori habitation in New Zealand. Following the arrival of Pākehā in the 19th century, the area saw widespread deforestation, farming, and quarrying, significantly modifying the area's environment. As a result of this, the park is one of the most modified landscapes of any of New Zealand's national parks, with management of the park largely focusing on regeneration and restoration of the traditional ecosystem.
                                                    
                                                    The park was first established in 1942 to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Abel Tasman's 1642 visit in New Zealand, when he became the first European to sight the islands. It has since been progressively expanded from its original borders, the most recent of which involved the addition of 7 hectares (17 acres) in Awaroa Inlet after a successful crowdfunding campaign.</p>

                            <p>Wharariki Beach is a hidden gem, known for its dramatic coastal landscape, featuring
                                towering sand dunes, wind-sculpted rock formations, and huge, arching cliffs. The
                                beach is often uncrowded, offering an idyllic escape into nature.
                                Highlights: Wild beauty, wildlife (seals and seabirds), and stunning views of
                                natural rock arches.</p>

                                                <p>The north-facing sandy beach is accessible only via a 20-minute walking track from the end of Wharariki Road. The road end is approximately 4 kilometres 2.5 mi from the nearest settlement, the small village of Pūponga. A camping ground is located along Wharariki Road, but the area surrounding the beach is devoid of any development. Wharariki Beach is bordered by Puponga Farm Park, with the wider area more or less surrounded by the northern end of Kahurangi National Park.

                                                    The beach is flanked to the east and west by cliffs, but due to the flat topography of the area behind it, the beach area and the grassy dunes behind it are quite exposed to winds.

                                                    Wharariki Beach is perhaps best known for the Archway Islands, a small archipelago of four islands ranging from the beachside part of the beach at low tide to roughly 250 metres 820 ft offshore. The islands are featured frequently in photos in New Zealand landscape calendars. It is also the default lock screen image on Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system.</p>

                                                <p>There is a wonderful little walk up the small headland at the southern end of the beach that goes over to Little Kaiteri, the bay you can see from the main beach. Even when the main beach is full of people desperately looking for some space to spread their towels out, Little Kaiteri can be more sparsely populated.

                                                    At the other end of Little Kaiteriteri is another, longer walk over a hill to Dummy Bay and Stephens Bays. Both of these beaches are magical, and are mainly frequently by locals. (Please don’t tell the locals you encounter on these beaches there where you got this information from. I get enough hate mail as it is!).

                                                    As mentioned, the estuary is a favourite swimming spot and particularly good for kids, although the currents do become stronger during certain tidal phases.

                                                    If you have younger children, then Kaiteriteri is also a good place for kids kayaking and other water sports. Waka Tours Abel Tasman operates from Kaiteriteri, and have fantastic activities for adults and kids of all ages.  Waka are traditional Maori canoes. Waka Tours include a paddle and some excellent insights into local Maori culture and history.</p>

                                                <p>Curio Bay is a coastal embayment in the Southland District of New Zealand, best known as the site of a petrified forest some 180 million years old. It also hosts a yellow-eyed penguin colony, arguably the rarest of penguin species, with approximately 1600 breeding pairs in the extant population. The bay, along with neighbouring Porpoise Bay, is home to the endemic Hector's dolphin.[1] Southern right whales are occasionally observed offshore, as on numerous parts of the country's coast.[2] Located near the southernmost point of the South Island,[3] Curio Bay is one of the major attractions in the Catlins, attracting around 100,000 visitors per year.[4] The town of Waikawa has an information centre for tourists.

                                                    The fossilised forest grew at a time of semi-tropical climate and before grasses and flowering plants had come into existence. The original forest of cycads, conifers and ferns was buried by massive floods of ash and volcanic debris either directly from a volcanic eruption or from later heavy rain on a barren volcanic mountain. Distinct bands of fossilised vegetation exposed in the cliff face indicate that in between such floods, the forest grew back at least four times over a period of some 20,000 years. Following this, the area remained buried over millions of years.</p>

                                                <p>The Muriwai area was uplifted from the sea floor between 3 and 5 million years ago. Much of the landscape is formed by remnants of the eastern side of the Waitākere Volcano, notably the pillow lava formations seen along the cliffs south of Muriwai beach. The area is primarily formed by sand, sedimentary rock and piha conglomerate. Cliff walls dominate much of southern Muriwai. Muriwai Beach has black sand, caused by the iron content derived from the ancient volcanoes in the area, including the large Kaipara Volcano which was situated offshore from the Kaipara Heads, and erupted 23-16 million years ago. The black sand is moved up the west coast of the North Island by longshore drift.

                                                    Oaia Island is an island located off the coast of Muriwai.

                                                    During the late 19th century, John Foster established a flax mill at Muriwai, stopping in 1893 when this became less economically viable. In 1894 Muriwai Valley School was established. The school only operated part-time, due to the school's rural location. At the turn of the century, politician and Mayor of Auckland City Edwin Mitchelson constructed a wooden mansion at Muriwai which he named Oaia, referencing adjacent Oaia Island.

                                                <p>Castlepoint is a small beachside settlement on the Wairarapa coast of the Wellington Region of New Zealand. It is home to a lighthouse which stands near the top of the northern end of a reef. The reef is about one kilometre long. At the southern end of the reef, there is an island known locally as "seagull island", due to its large population of seagulls. The southern side of Castle Rock is known as Christmas Bay. Castlepoint is approximately one hour's drive from Masterton.

                                                    Castlepoint was so named in 1770 by Captain Cook who was struck by the similarities of Castle Rock to the battlements of a castle. The Maori name for the area is Rangiwhakaoma, which translates as 'where the sky runs'. Smaller cetaceans such as dolphins frequent around Castlepoint while larger whales such as southern right whales and humpback whales may be visible from the shores during their migration seasons. A book chronicling the history of Castlepoint, including Castlepoint Station, Castle Point Lighthouse and the local fishing industry was published in October 2010 by Hedleys Books of Masterton.
                                                    
                                                    Castle Rock is a landmark in Castlepoint and is 162m high. It includes a walk through woods and over bridges and is approximately 45 minutes long.
                                                    
                                                    Mataikona Sand Dunes are an area of large sand dunes approximately 30 minutes north of Castlepoint towards the Matakona River mouth.</p>

                                                <p>Te Henga, or Bethells Beach, is a coastal community in West Auckland, New Zealand. The Māori name for the area, "Te Henga", is in reference to the long foredunes which run along the beach and look like the Henga or gunwale of an upturned waka hull. This name originally applied to a wide area of the lower Waitakere River valley, but during the early 1900s the area became popular with visiting European immigrants who began to refer to the area as "Bethells Beach" after the Bethell Family who live there and still own much of the area. In 1976 the New Zealand Geographic Board officially named the area "Te Henga (Bethells Beach)".

                                                    The beach is approximately 37 km (23 mi) west of Auckland City, at the mouth of the Waitakere River where it flows into the Tasman Sea. One of several popular resorts in the area (others include Muriwai, Piha and Karekare), it is rated the 4th most dangerous beach in New Zealand to swim at due to its strong rips and currents. There have been many fatalities including in 2009, Rugby League star Sonny Fai, who was never located. 

                                                    The Te Henga Valley shows evidence of human settlement dating back many centuries. Carbon dating of midden shells at Kauwahaia Island date settlement back to at least the year 1600.</p>

                                                I boogie board here regularly and depend on the advice from the surfers to where the rips are and how strong the current is.
