                                                    It is part of the Keenaght Hills,[2] which mark the western edge of
                                                    the Antrim Plateau, formed around 60 million years ago by molten
                                                    lava. Binevenagh and its cliffs overlook the Magilligan peninsula
                                                    and dominate the skyline over the villages of Bellarena, Downhill,
                                                    Castlerock and Benone beach. The area has been classified as both an
                                                    Area of Special Scientific Interest[3] and as an Area of Outstanding
                                                    Natural Beauty (AONB).[4] The total area of the AONB is 138 km2.

                                                    of Roger Casement" is a different song) is an Irish rebel song about
                                                    the failed transport of arms into Ireland for use in the Easter
                                                    Rising. Authorship of the song is unknown. The final verse was
                                                    written by Derek Warfield of the Wolfe Tones in 1965 when Roger
                                                    Casement's remains were finally returned to Ireland.

                                                    The first and second verses were re-written in 2016 by 'Tintean' a
                                                    Kerry-based folk group, to provide a more factual and historically
                                                    correct depiction of events.

                                                    'On the twenty first of April, good Friday at the dawn.
                                                    A German boat was seen to float outside of Carrahane.
                                                    'With twenty thousand rifles, all ready for to land.'
                                                    And waiting for a signal
                                                    from the shores of Banna Strand.

                                                    A motor-car was dashing through the early morning gloom.
                                                    A sudden crash, and in the sea, they went to meet their doom
                                                    Three Irish lads lay dying there, just like their hopes so grand

                                                <p>Garretstown Beach is an expansive sandy beach located along the coast
                                                    of County Cork. It has stunning views of the Old Head of Kinsale and
                                                    is a great place for walking, bathing and swimming.
                                                    Garretstown Beach is located within a short distance of
                                                    Ballinspittle Village by car. Facilities include a car park and
                                                    toilets. There is also a pitch and putt course nearby.

                                                    There is a surf school at the beach providing lessons and equipment
                                                    hire for surfing, body boarding and stand-up paddle boarding.

                                                    Great little beach for water sports and just relaxing. Itâ€™s the
                                                    biggest in the area, however, beaches in Cork are small compared to
                                                    some on the West coast. Best time is when the tide is out as the
                                                    white sand will give you plenty of room. Once the tide is in you
                                                    have to move up onto the pebbles. Plenty of parking around, coffee
                                                    shop, water sport rental, no public toilets though. You can also go
                                                    on an extended walk right along the coastline if you are fit.

                                                    Great beach for watching the water sports if not taking part. No
                                                    toilet facilities or place to eat but wonderful to walk along and
                                                    breathe in the great fresh air. Really clears the cobwebs.</p>

                                                    northeast of Wexford town, it is on the R742 road at the junction
                                                    with the R743 road. It is linked to the long and sandy Curracloe
                                                    Strand (beach) 4 km (2.5 mi) to the east. Curracloe sees an influx
                                                    of holiday travellers every summer, who stay in bed & breakfast
                                                    inns, mobile homes and caravan parks.

                                                    Ballinesker Beach and Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, were used for
                                                    the filming of the D-Day sequence in Saving Private Ryan, due to
                                                    similarity to Omaha Beach in Normandy. Filming began 27 June 1997,
                                                    and lasted for two months. The village of Curracloe lacked
                                                    three-phase electricity but when the film company decided to film
                                                    there, it was connected. Curracloe Strand was also used for the
                                                    Irish beach scene in the movie Brooklyn.</p>

                                                    sandy beach with sand dunes and cliff walks.
                                                    Tramore (TrÃ¡ MÃ³r in Gaelic, meaning big strand), is one of the most
                                                    aptly named towns in the region, with its famous 5km golden, sandy
                                                    beach surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean. The most spectacular
                                                    approach to this exciting resort is the route from Annestown, County
                                                    Waterford, and the coast road to the elevated western suburbs of the
                                                    town.

                                                    The panorama of Tramore Bay, with the protecting arm of Brownstown
                                                    Head beyond, is truly magnificent. The town itself is built on a
                                                    hill that slopes down to the strand. The long, rolling waves in
                                                    Tramore make it popular with water sports enthusiasts.

                                                <p>Portmarnock (Irish: Port MearnÃ³g) is a coastal suburban settlement in
                                                    Fingal, Ireland, with significant beaches, a modest commercial core
                                                    and inland residential estates, and two golf courses, including one
                                                    of Ireland's best-known golf clubs. As of 2022, the population was
                                                    10,750, an increase of 13.5% on the Census 2016 figure of 9,466.

                                                    Portmarnock is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock
                                                    in the traditional County Dublin.

                                                    The district's name derives from the Irish word port â€“ meaning
                                                    "port" â€“ and Saint Marnoch or Mernoc, said to have arrived in what
                                                    is now Portmarnock in the fifth century AD.

                                                    The area had been settled in Neolithic times, as evidenced by flints
                                                    and other tools excavated on the northern fringe of Portmarnock and
                                                    the remains of a ring fort visible from the air at the south of the
                                                    town. The son of Queen Maedhbh of Connaught â€“ Maine â€“ is also said
                                                    to have been buried locally.

                                                    named "Ilanlik". Its current name literally means "Old border

                                                    been included in Romania in 1913. In 1940, however, that region was
                                                    returned to Bulgaria, and the village has since lain once again near

                                                    Even in Communist Romania, Vama Veche had the reputation of a

                                                    Romanian Revolution of 1989. During the communist era, concern for
                                                    border patrol sight lines spared Vama Veche the development that
                                                    occurred in other Romanian Black Sea resorts. It became a hangout

                                                <p>Curracloe (Irish: Currach ClÃ³, meaning 'marsh of the impression') is
                                                    a village in County Wexford, Ireland. Around 8 kilometres (5 mi)
                                                    northeast of Wexford town, it is on the R742 road at the junction
                                                    with the R743 road. It is linked to the long and sandy Curracloe
                                                    Strand (beach) 4 km (2.5 mi) to the east. Curracloe sees an influx
                                                    of holiday travellers every summer, who stay in bed & breakfast
                                                    inns, mobile homes and caravan parks.

                                                    Ballinesker Beach and Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, were used for
                                                    the filming of the D-Day sequence in Saving Private Ryan, due to
                                                    similarity to Omaha Beach in Normandy. Filming began 27 June 1997,
                                                    and lasted for two months. The village of Curracloe lacked
                                                    three-phase electricity but when the film company decided to film
                                                    there, it was connected. Curracloe Strand was also used for the
                                                    Irish beach scene in the movie Brooklyn.</p>

                                                    the Blue Flag and Green Coast awards. The Blue Flag is an
                                                    international environmental award made to beaches and marinas

                                                    and have good sanitary and safety facilities. The Green Coast Award
                                                    recognises beaches for their clean environment, excellent water

                                                    refreshing dip. Even the sand is perfect. Fine enough to build
                                                    sandcastles, but not so fine that would blow into your snacks ðŸ˜Š.
                                                    Conveniently, the beach is only a hundred yards from the pier. So

                                                <p>Keem Bay (Irish: Cuan na Cuime) is located past Dooagh village in the
                                                    west of Achill Island in County Mayo, Ireland. It contains a Blue
                                                    Flag beach. The bay was formerly the site of a basking shark
                                                    fishery.

                                                    During the 19th century, the British government established a
                                                    lifeboat station on Keem Beach. The lifeboat station was operational
                                                    for over 100 years providing a vital service for those who lived and
                                                    worked on the coast.

                                                    The bay was used as a filming location for the 2022 film The

                                                <p>Spanish Point (Irish: Rinn na SpÃ¡inneach) is a village in the parish of Milltown Malbay in County Clare on the west coast of Ireland. It has many holiday homes, and in winter a significantly smaller population. The Beach, over a kilometre long, has Blue Flag Status and is suitable for swimming and surfing. It is also one of the better known surf breaks in County Clare. The name refers to the wrecking of some ships of the Spanish Armada off the coast.

                                                    On the coast, 2.5 km (1.6 mi) from Milltown Malbay, Spanish Point was named after the Spanish who died here in 1588, when many ships of the Spanish Armada were wrecked during stormy weather. Those who escaped from their sinking ships and made it safely to land were later executed by Sir Turlough O'Brien of Liscannor and Boethius Clancy, High Sheriff of Clare.
                                                    
                                                    It was not known by the English authorities in Ireland whether the Spanish sailed this way around Ireland because their ships were damaged and the storm prevented them from sailing back the quick way or if it was part of a Spanish plan to invade Ireland </p>
