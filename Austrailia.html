                                                        km) offshore that protects Grace Bay from the ocean swells of the
                                                        Atlantic, which helps to keep the water at the beach calm and safe.
    
                                                        Grace Bay Beach is home to most of the large, luxury resorts on

                                                    <p>Whitehaven Beach is on Whitsunday Island, Queensland, Australia. The island is accessible by boat, seaplane & helicopter from Airlie Beach, as well as Hamilton Island. It lies across from Stockyard Beach, better known as Chalkie's Beach, on Haslewood Island. The seven kilometres beach is known for its crystal white silica sands and turquoise coloured waters. The beach has tour barbeque and camping facilities.
    
                                                        The beach was awarded Queensland's Cleanest Beach in Keep Australia Beautiful's 2008 Beach Challenge State Awards. In July 2010, Whitehaven Beach was named the top Eco Friendly Beach in the world by CNN.com. In 2014, tourism website TripAdvisor placed Whitehaven Beach in its top five on a list of the best beaches worldwide.
    
                                                        Dogs are not permitted on the beach and cigarette smoking is prohibited.
                                                        Whitehaven Beach is known for its bright white sands, which consist of 98% pure silica. Local rocks do not contain silica so it has been suggested that the sands were brought to the beach by prevailing sea currents over millions of years.</p>

                                crystal-clear waters, and a backdrop of lush rainforests and the mountains of the Daintree National
                                Park.
            
                                The beach is ideal for swimming, relaxing, and strolling, offering scenic views of nearby Low Isles
                                and the Great Barrier Reef. However, the waters can sometimes be subject to strong currents, so
                                caution is advised for swimmers.</p>

                                                        There was a passion in those comments that really made me think about Wineglass Bay and why it has such an impact on people. That single image of that single beach seems to have stirred all kinds of feelings and memories. 
    
                                                        AThere is something about Wineglass Bay that is so alluring, that it remains imprinted in the memory long after the experience itself has passed.
    
                                                        I have my own memories of Wineglass—that I’m lucky enough to renew on a pretty regular basis. When I first walked here, I was backpacking around the state, having adventures. I remember seeing it for the first time from the lookout, and the feeling of anticipation as I walked down to the bay in the summer heat, and the extraordinary feeling of emerging from the forest onto that white sand. And I will never forget the feeling of stepping into that turquoise ocean for the first time.
                                                        
                                                        It was so beautiful that I stayed two days and nights, swimming, wandering, but mostly sitting and looking.</p>

                                                <p>From Torquay to Portland and beyond there are literally hundreds of bay and ocean beaches to choose from, and they are magnificent all year round. In summer they act as a cool retreat, while in winter a wonderful backdrop to witness with big swell.

                                                    It may be tempting to jump in anywhere along the coast, but we advise it’s best to look for the yellow and red beach flags. They signify that there are lifesavers around looking after you and your family, at patrolled beaches. You can help by swimming between the flags and being conscious of beach safety.

                                                    The safe, protected sandy front beach is popular with families. Fishermans Beach is a favourite for boating, sailing and windsurfing. The back beach, also known as the surf beach, is usually safe for swimming and surfing. Lifesavers patrol during summer.

                                                    <p>It is less than two metres deep inside this naturally formed lagoon. A good range of fish species resides within the pool, particularly in the holes and crevices in the southern section. They include red-lip morwong, banded sweep, bullseyes, wrasse, schools of buffalo bream, sea mullet, tarwine and blowfish. Sand whiting and Australian herring can be seen in the open water.
    
                                                        You may also notice a few anemones growing within the pool, while cushion stars, abalone and other shellfish species hide in the rocky reef top. While the snorkelling inside the lagoon is easy, the surge can be strong on the outer edge of the reef. Beware of cobblers in the weed near the shore.
    
                                                        Beautiful oasis on the Metro coast. If you feel like a dip in the ocean without the waves, this is the place for you. Only room for splashing about amongst the reef, but worth it. There's a deeper pool where you can safely snorkel.
    
                                                        We were there around 11am, so visibility wasn’t good for any snorkling. However, we had a great swim. Fine soft sand and relaxing (even though it was windy). Definitely going back again.</p>

The best way to get there is to take the White Sands Walk from Greenfield Beach or Vincentia, that way you get to enjoy more than one of Jervis Bay’s spectacular white sand beaches.
    
                                                        Found on the southern shores of the splendid Jervis Bay Marine Park, the calm turquoise waters of Hyams Beach are perfect for swimming, snorkelling and stand-up paddle boarding. Stroll the beach and feel the soft sands squeak underfoot or roll out your towel and listen to the gentle waves.
    
                                                        The marine park is a haven for bottlenose dolphins, fur seals and little penguins. You’ll also see humpback and southern right whales during their annual migration along the NSW South Coast. Tours to see dolphins and migrating whales depart from Huskisson, a short drive north of Hyams Beach.
    
                                                        Known for its sugar-white sand, Hyams Beach is an idyllic holiday destination, with crystal clear waters and a fringe of national park completing the picture. Uncover scenic coastal walks, meet native wildlife and explore the glittering ocean in this small village in the Shoalhaven region of the NSW South Coast.

                                                    <p>Byron Bay and surrounds are located on traditional lands of the Bundjalung Nation of the Arakwal, Minjungbal and the Widjabul people who have lived by the coast for at least 22,000 years.[3] Traditional custodians of the region believe that the land and people were created by Nguthungulli, who rests at what is now called Julian Rocks.[4] The traditional name of the township area was Cavvanbah, meaning "meeting place".[5] Significant totems for the area include Wajung and Kabul.[6]
    
                                                        In 1770 Lieutenant James Cook found safe anchorage and named Cape Byron after a fellow sailor Vice Admiral 'Foul-Weather Jack' John Byron, circumnavigator of the world and grandfather of the poet Lord Byron.[7][8] European settlement in the area took place in the 1830s. A massacre took place in the 1850s, south of Suffolk Park where the quarry is today.[4]
    
                                                        The first industry in Byron was cedar logging from the Australian red cedar (Toona ciliata). The timber industry is the origin of the word "shoot" in many local names – Possum Shoot, Coopers Shoot and Skinners Shoot – where the timber-cutters would "shoot" the logs down the hills to be dragged to waiting ships.

                                                    With calm, sheltered waters, Noosa Main Beach is one of few north-facing beaches in Australia, meaning that conditions are often beautifully calm, clear and flat. Bordered by the stunning green expanse of the Noosa National Park on one side, the long sandy stretch of the Noosa North Shore on the other, and with distant hinterland views providing the perfect backdrop for epic early-evening sunset views.

                                                    Take a dip at Noosa’s most famous beach, nestled behind the Noosa National Park, with sheltered waters, and long stretches of golden sand.

                                                    <p>Palm Cove is located in Far North Queensland on the Australian coast. It has a long sandy beach along most of its seafront except for the rocky headland around Buchan Point in the north of the suburb.
    
                                                        Arlington Reef is the closest section of The Great Barrier Reef to Palm Cove being around 30 kilometres 19 mi offshore. The reef shelters the inshore waters from the Coral Sea swells creating relatively calm waters between the reef and the beach. To the west of Palm Cove is the Macalister Range National Park which is part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area.
                                                        
                                                        The first documented British visit to the area was by a coastal expedition led by George Elphinstone Dalrymple in 1873. Dalrymple's group had stopped in the area for a few days and accessed a large lagoon at Palm Cove. Immediately after landing a large number of Aboriginal people came out of their camps, and attempted to prevent the groups passage to the lagoon. Darlrymple's group used gunfire. After all of the group "heartily rejoiced at the severe lesson which their unwarrantable hostility had brought upon them".</p>

                            <p>Elliston Beach is a hidden gem located on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, offering
                                pristine beaches, clear waters, and dramatic coastal cliffs. The beach is often quiet,
                                providing a peaceful setting for relaxation and beach walks. It’s a great place for
                                swimming, fishing, and exploring the nearby sea caves and rock formations. The colourful
                                sunsets over the ocean add an extra layer of magic to the already breathtaking scenery. </p>

                                                    <p>The first recorded exploration of the adjacent coastline was by Matthew Flinders in the vessel HMS Investigator from 10–13 February 1802. He named the offshore islands but did not note the presence of Waterloo Bay in his log.
    
                                                        Edward John Eyre explored the area on land in 1840 and 1841 on a journey to Western Australia from Port Lincoln. Originally named Waterloo Bay, the township was later named by Governor Sir William Jervois on a plan for the town on 23 November 1878. It is named after the writer and educator Ellen Liston who was born in London in 1838 and emigrated to South Australia in 1850. She was a governess working on a local property (Nilkerloo) owned by John Hamp.
    
                                                        The town of Elliston lies on Waterloo Bay, a small coastal inlet which is partially protected by a number of reefs lining the entrance to the bay. Outside of the bay, the coastline is exclusively large cliffs, with a number of surf beaches located on these stretches.
                                                        Offshore, Flinders Island is 32 kilometres (20 mi) west south west of Wellington Point at Elliston.</p>

                                                        The best snorkelling is accessed via the Bay Loop parking area which is towards the northern half of the bay, well away from the potentially strong currents found at the sandy point at the southern end of the bay.
                                                        
                                                        Park at the Drift Loop parking area to access the popular drift snorkelling site south of Turquoise Bay’s sandy point. A natural current flows from south to north taking you over beautiful corals.
    
                                                        Walk approximately 200m south of the track that leads you on to the beach from the Drift Loop parking area. Enter the water at the southern end of the beach and let the current take you over the reef for a fantastic snorkelling experience. </p>

                                                <p>While exploring the south coast of Australia in 1802, Matthew Flinders sailed a dangerous route through the Recherche Archipelago.

                                                    He named it Lucky Bay when his vessel HMS Investigator took shelter here from a summer storm. The botanist Robert Brown went ashore and explored a diverse and largely unknown flora, discovering and naming many new species. A plaque on the rocks at the eastern end of the bay celebrates this historic event.
                                                    
                                                    Set up camp at Lucky Bay Campground, explore the trails and visit the beach which is arguably the whitest sand in Australia. 
                                                    
                                                    Be aware that these beaches are notoriously treacherous for vehicles and it is easy to become bogged in the most innocent looking wet or dry sand.
