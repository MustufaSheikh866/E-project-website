                            <p>Luskentyre Beach is renowned for its stunning white sands and crystal-clear turquoise waters. The
                                backdrop of rugged mountains and wild landscapes adds to its natural beauty, making it one of the
                                most photographed beaches in Scotland. Despite being in the northern part of Europe, the beach
                                offers a Caribbean-like vibe on a clear day.</p>

                                                    <p>Luskentyre (Scottish Gaelic: Losgaintir) is a sparse settlement on
                                                        the west coast of Harris, in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland.
                                                        Luskentyre is situated within the parish of Harris.[1] The name
                                                        Luskentyre derives from Lios-cinn-tir, meaning 'headland fort',
                                                        although there is no trace or local knowledge of a fort at the
                                                        headland.[2] However, the headland contains the site of an old part
                                                        of Luskentyre Cemetery.[3] Luskentyre Beach has been voted Britain's
                                                        best beach.[4] Luskentyre is accessible from the A859, via a minor
                                                        road.[5]
    
                                                        I was fortunate enough to have the time to get over from Glasgow when there was a decent spell of weather over in the Outer Hebridies, I was over 2 years ago for a charity walk of the hebridean way but was on a tight schedule to get back home & I never managed to get to Luskentyre, so I was really looking forward to going there..I wild camped on hill out the way, overlooking the beach, the views were out of this world & I was treated to a spectacular sunset, the next morning I packed up & headed down the hill and along the beach, i had it to myself, it was one of the best experiences of my life, it was heavenly..a dream come true, a memory I'll cherish for the rest of my life.</p>

                                                    <p>North Cape (Norwegian: Nordkapp; Northern Sami: Davvenjárga) is a cape on the northern coast of the island of Magerøya in Northern Norway. The cape is in Nordkapp Municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The European route E69 motorway (highway) has its northern terminus at North Cape, which makes it the northernmost point in Europe that can be accessed by car and makes the E69 the northernmost public road in Europe. The plateau is a popular tourist attraction. The cape includes a 307-metre-high cliff (1,007 ft) with a large flat plateau on top, where visitors, weather permitting, can watch the midnight sun and views of the Barents Sea to the north. North Cape Hall, a visitor centre, was built in 1988 on the plateau. It includes a café, restaurant, post office, souvenir shop, a small museum, and video cinema.[1][2]
    
                                                        The North Cape was named by the Englishman Steven Borough, captain of the Edward Bonaventure, which sailed past in 1553 in search of the Northeast Passage.[1]

                                                    <p>Navagio Beach (Greek: Παραλία Ναυάγιο, pronounced [naˈvaʝio]), or Shipwreck Beach, is an exposed cove, sometimes referred to as "Smugglers Cove", on the coast of Zakynthos, in the Ionian Islands of Greece. Navagio Beach was originally known as Agios Georgios.
    
                                                        On 5 October 1980, the coaster MV Panagiotis, ran aground in the waters around Zakynthos Island on Navagio Beach during stormy weather and bad visibility. Some rumours claim the ship was smuggling contraband; however, official sources did not confirm this, and the captain was not convicted for such offences at the time. Recently released court documents and photos relating to the incident back up the smuggler story, suggesting that Panagiotis was allegedly making its way from Turkey with a freight of contraband cigarettes headed for Italy. Encountering stormy weather, the ship ran aground in the cove, where the crew abandoned her to evade the pursuing Navy.[2] The ship was abandoned and still rests buried in the limestone gravel of the beach that now bears the nickname Shipwreck.[3]
    
                                                        The beach was briefly closed in 2018, and swimming and boat anchoring were forbidden, after a cliff above the beach collapsed.[4] The beach reopened and anchoring is permitted, but with restrictions out of concerns over future landslides.[5]</p>

                                                    <p>t shouldn’t take much to convince you that Rabbit Beach (Spiaggia dei Conigli) on the small island of Lampedusa is one of the world’s most beautiful beaches. This Mediterranean locale is Italy’s southernmost island—closer to Tunisia than it is to Italy—with beaches perfect for sunbathing, adventure, and everything in between. In addition to its welcoming shores for travelers, this cove-style beach is a habitat for loggerhead turtles, which you can see during their egg laying and hatching seasons.
    
                                                        When is the best time to visit Rabbit Beach? You should travel during the late spring to early autumn (May to September), when the weather is warm enough to enjoy outdoor activities, and the water is most welcoming.
                                                        
                                                        How long should you stay at Rabbit Beach? A couple of days is a good amount of time to explore the area and enjoy the beach.
    
                                                        What can you see and do at Rabbit Beach? The area is great for swimming and snorkeling, and for just hanging out and enjoying the Mediterranean weather. Boating and fishing aren’t allowed in the protected area, but there are tours you can take around the area, plus there are scuba diving centers in Lampedusa.
    
                                                        How do you get to Rabbit Beach? There are flights to Lampedusa (from other islands or the mainland), as well as ferries. You can take a car from downtown close to the beach, which is accessible via footpath.</p>

There are more than 450 metres of beach divided into two parts by a small rocky area in the middle. Its name refers to several islets that lie off this stretch of coast and which are known by the names of: Illa de Tramuntana, Illa des Forn, Escull des Pou, Illa Redona and Escull d’en Palla. Their presence makes the landscape of this beach even more unique.

                                                    The most outstanding feature of this beach is its calm, shallow, turquoise waters, which, together with the fine white sand, create a paradisiacal landscape. Moreover, being a natural park, the surroundings are well cared for, with dune protection areas, access walkways and specific areas where you can park without causing an impact on the terrain. There are also various restaurants of different kinds to be found along these coasts. It is also an ideal beach for children, due to its safety and the different services available to visitors.
                                                    
                                                    The great extension of this beach allows visitors to find a space on the sand without overcrowding, especially in the northern area with the Trucadors peninsula, an arm of sand that connects with the neighbouring Llevant beach.</p>

Golden Sands was privatized in the 1990s and attracted considerable investment through the 2000s. Designed initially for 13,000 hotel beds, it had over 30,000 beds reported in 2007; according to Varna Tourist Chamber sources, the actual number was significantly higher,[1] by some unverified critical estimates even approaching 90,000.[2] Currently, most hotels offer all-inclusive vacations, but there are also concerted efforts to reposition the resort as a high-end destination.
    
                                                        The area is labelled to have the purest quartz sand on the coast and abounds in old trees, landscaped gardens, and pedestrian malls. Golden Sands authorities resist demands to provide more automobile roads and car parks, citing the resort's reputation as family friendly, green, and a largely pedestrian place.</p>

                                                    <p>On 5 October 1980, the coaster MV Panagiotis, ran aground in the waters around Zakynthos Island on Navagio Beach during stormy weather and bad visibility. Some rumours claim the ship was smuggling contraband; however, official sources did not confirm this, and the captain was not convicted for such offences at the time. Recently released court documents and photos relating to the incident back up the smuggler story, suggesting that Panagiotis was allegedly making its way from Turkey with a freight of contraband cigarettes headed for Italy. Encountering stormy weather, the ship ran aground in the cove, where the crew abandoned her to evade the pursuing Navy.The ship was abandoned and still rests buried in the limestone gravel of the beach that now bears the nickname Shipwreck.
    
                                                        The beach was briefly closed in 2018, and swimming and boat anchoring were forbidden, after a cliff above the beach collapsed. The beach reopened and anchoring is permitted, but with restrictions out of concerns over future landslides.
                                                        
                                                        In September 2022 another landslide occurred, after a 5.4-magnitude earthquake took place between Kefalonia and Zakynthos. After this the beach was closed to locals and visitors and will remain closed for the whole summer of 2023 till at least September.

                            <h4>Vama Veche</h4>
                            <p> Vama Veche is a laid-back, bohemian beach known for its peaceful, alternative vibe. The
                                beach is wide, with golden sand and clear, shallow waters, making it perfect for swimming.
                                Its unique charm lies in its relaxed atmosphere, free from the overdeveloped resorts that
                                line much of the Black Sea coast. It’s also a popular spot for camping, live music, and
                                enjoying the local culture.</p>

                                                <p>It was founded in 1811 by a few Gagauz families, originally being named "Ilanlik". Its current name literally means "Old border checkpoint", named so after Southern Dobruja (the Cadrilater) had been included in Romania in 1913. In 1940, however, that region was returned to Bulgaria, and the village has since lain once again near the border, but the name stuck.

                                                    Even in Communist Romania, Vama Veche had the reputation of a non-mainstream tourist destination, which has only grown since the Romanian Revolution of 1989. During the communist era, concern for border patrol sight lines spared Vama Veche the development that occurred in other Romanian Black Sea resorts. It became a hangout for intellectuals; for reasons that are not exactly clear, the generally repressive regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu chose to tolerate this countercultural oasis, as long as people had their identity papers with them. Accommodations consisted of tents or rooms rented from peasants or fishermen. While camping is theoretically not permitted, to this day, many visitors or semi-permanent residents still stay in tents on the beach.</p>

                                                        Arlington Reef is the closest section of The Great Barrier Reef to Palm Cove being around 30 kilometres 19 mi offshore. The reef shelters the inshore waters from the Coral Sea swells creating relatively calm waters between the reef and the beach. To the west of Palm Cove is the Macalister Range National Park which is part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area.
                                                        
                                                        The first documented British visit to the area was by a coastal expedition led by George Elphinstone Dalrymple in 1873. Dalrymple's group had stopped in the area for a few days and accessed a large lagoon at Palm Cove. Immediately after landing a large number of Aboriginal people came out of their camps, and attempted to prevent the groups passage to the lagoon. Darlrymple's group used gunfire. After all of the group "heartily rejoiced at the severe lesson which their unwarrantable hostility had brought upon them".</p>

Its name Concha is given upon its remarkably regular shape. The scenic setting in the Bay of La Concha and the 19th century elegance of fashionable seaside resorts have made the site very popular, as it is frequently cited as one of the most beautiful and the most famous urban beaches in Europe.


                                                    Léon Degrelle's Heinkel He 111 that landed in the waters of La Concha
                                                    Léon Degrelle, a Belgian politician and one of the most notable Nazi collaborators during World War II, made a water landing at La Concha in May 1945 to escape Allied repercussion. He would go into exile in the country until his death in 1994. In addition, the beach of La Concha is referenced in Ernest Hemingway's classic The Sun Also Rise; the main character Jake Barnes briefly swims and dives in the Beach of La Concha at the end.

                                                    <p>Smiths Beach near Yallingup on the south west coast is where the locals go for summer holidays.
    
                                                        Here, the swimming, fishing and surfing are top class. Sheltered areas offer great conditions for family swimming, while further along, surf breaks are popular for boogy boarders and surfers. The wide expanse of white sand at Smiths Beach is perfect for beach combing and walking. Entire days can be spent relaxing in the sunshine, taking a refreshing dip in the sea, and unwinding from the pressures of every day.
                                                        
                                                        Smiths Beach is also the ideal place to watch spectacular sunsets over the Indian Ocean.
